The purpose of the project is a simple implementation of data mining techiques and methodologies, as a training exercise.
The data set in use: data.csv includes information and statistics about the COVID-19 pandemic for 104 countries.

The purpose:

-Utilize basic data preprocessing techinques, examine the starting data set, find correlations between the
different fields and perform a basic statistical analysis on the whole data set.

-Visualize the above findings with the help of appropriate graphs.

-Cluster the different countries by how well they dealed with the pandemic.

-Separating Greece from the dataset, create two daily predictors for the positive test rate for the next 3 days.

-Train two regresors, one based on RNNs and one SVM. Analysize the results.
